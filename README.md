This project it's a simple CRUD developed with Django, for the Back-end and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the Front-end
The DataBase used was the standard Sqlite of Django

In the menu page you will have all those options bellow:

For each hiperlink in the options above you will move to different HTML pages

In each HTML template I've applied a simple CSS edition, but the focus of that project was to learn the 4 options that a CRUD project teach us

C -> Create -> Post | 
R -> Read -> Get | 
U -> Update -> Put | 
D -> Delete -> Delete | 
 
I hope you enjoy!
